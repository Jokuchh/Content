# Detailed Information about hidden repositories


1️⃣Stork-of-Freedom : Charity NFT collection the main goal of which is to show the whole world Ukrainian symbols, culture, religion and our rich history through NFTs.

✅Done : Web-page for Charity NFT project, dealing with smart contract, team leader of this project, mission statement & organisation process.

2️⃣Robotech : The project is about two collaborative robots that continuously inform each other of the progress of the missions thanks to robust wireless communications.

✅Done :Presentation/Report about project; Arm Conception which was developed in the spring of 2022.

3️⃣Research-Sensitivity-Analysis. The stake of our research is the safety of the installation which consists in carrying out studies to eliminate the uncertainties of exceeding the threshold level by the flood level (overflow S). To do this we will use the flood model which is based on a simplification of 1D hydrodynamic equations under the assumptions of constant and uniform discharge and very large rectangular section.

✅Done :Full analysis and Report about it.

4️⃣Advanced-Programming-C# Practice: interactive programation module

✅Done : Tasks 

5️⃣Continuation-Fundamentals-of-Algorithmization-n-Programming : This repository is a continuation of the Fundamentals of Algorithmization and Programming and covers advanced topics in the C language. Here is represented how i was dealing with structured types, dynamically manage memory, work with lists, using standard libraries, etc. and learn the basics of microcontroller programming using the Arduino Uno.

✅Done : All of the tasks which are represented on the website. You can find the link here : https://kurzy.kpi.fei.tuke.sk/pvjc/2022/

6️⃣Various-Games : Different games as in 2D as on the microcontroller board. Practice for myself and perfect representation of my skills.

✅Done : All of the tasks which are represented on the website. You can find the link here : https://kurzy.kpi.fei.tuke.sk/pvjc/2022/

7️⃣Machine-Learning-n-Artificial-Intelligence : Different Machine Learning methods. Usage explaining.

✅Done : Four different works :Clustering method; KPPV; SVM; Regression Non Linear; And a report about all of this.

8️⃣Fundamentals-of-Algorithmization-n-programming : First steps in IT which aims to acquire basic knowledge and skills for the analysis, design and creation of algorithms, as well as the implementation and testing of selected tasks in the form of programs in the procedural language C. During 3 months, I've learned the basic language constructs of the language.

✅Done : All of the tasks which are represented on the website. You can find the link here : https://kurzy.kpi.fei.tuke.sk/zap/

9️⃣IoT-RFID : The project is about contactless communication by using RFID/NFC to create and test payment device, unlock the door which is locked by system.

✅Done : Tasks and report
